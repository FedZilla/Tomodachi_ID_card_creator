#### Why this project?
* The project is basically a personal project to help a streamer friend, [**Necrokix7**](https://www.twitch.tv/necrokix7), who streams on Tomodachi Life and invites his community to get into the game, but to do this he needed photos to create the viewer character. The problem here was that no two screens looked the same, and some people used images from others to modify them, creating confusion with incomprehensible images, which is why this project was born.
